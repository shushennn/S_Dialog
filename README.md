The information includes vaccination numbers for different vaccines in different states and in whole Germany. 
The chatbot has an integrated Eliza to keep a dialog flowing and ask questions. 
It can also recognizes user's emotions. 
The chatbot can also calculate the latest 7-day incidence in Germany and tell you whether according to the result, there should or shouldn't be a lockdown (if stores, pool or other public spaces are closed).
